# GBD-Epilepsy-2021
Global, regional, and national burden of epilepsy, 1990â€“2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021
(Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON)

Seizures and their consequences contribute to the burden of epilepsy because they can cause health loss
(premature mortality and residual disability). Data on the burden of epilepsy are needed for health-care planning and
resource allocation. The aim of this study was to quantify health loss due to epilepsy by age, sex, year, and location
using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study.

This is in collaboration with NISAN on the systematic analysis project for the Global Burden of Disease Study. My work with the IHME is under my role of research assistant at NISAN-AUT.
